        <p align="left" class="lead" style="margin-top: 10px; color: black;">
            <u>Justification:</u>
            Task 1: Why is this project needed, what is the business value, how will it help solve the problem?
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="lead" style="margin-top: 10px; color: black;">
            <u>Solution:</u>
            Task 1:
           // The key is to identify the problem, the current dilemma is that faculty and students have gone through
           // multiple iterations of updates that UTEP online software has provided and in some cases no updates whatsoever,
           // but continues to miss the most important aspects of software.
            Problems:
        </p>
        <p align="left" class="lead" style="margin-top: 10px; color: black;">
            1) Instead of having a traditional registration method of filling forms, that in some cases users have to input
            information that is already known such as First Name , Last Name , Student ID, GPA.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="lead" style="margin-top: 10px; color: black;">
            2) If you want to register for a course often times you would have to manually check the system to see if there
            is a pre-requisite to need to take before hand.
        </p>
        <p align="left" class="lead" style="margin-top: 10px; color: black;">
            3) The last issue you would have to get your courses holds removed by a faculty member which is a very slow
            process.
        </p>
        <p align="left" class="lead" style="margin-top: 10px; color: black;">
            4) Another issue would be for students that are currently enrolled in an Online Programs or are Transfers/Internation
            students will have to be physically in the registration office.
        </p>
        <p align="left" class="lead" style="margin-top: 10px; color: black;">
            In the following sections we will be defining
            our perfect registration system, S.U.R.S for students which will include more attractive aesthetics
            that Goldmine currently has, MinerMe a personal feature that can recommend courses and an easy-to-use
            registering system.
        </p>

        <p align="left" class="lead" style="margin-top: 10px; color: black;">
            <u>Scope Description:</u>
            Task 2: Key characteristics of the product. Make sure to clearly identify the key functionality that will be
            provided. Also describe what features will not be within scope.
        </p>
        <p align="left" class="lead" style="margin-top: 10px; color: black;">
            <u>Solution:</u>
            Task 2:
            Identifying the problem will guide us make a more user friendly registration for incoming students that have
            minimum experience with our Goldmine system.The key characteristics of the product will
            be having an interface where existing users can log in and view their courses. Common issues are students not having the sufficient knowledge
            of their degree plan and the pre-requisites of the courses.  Solving this issue will ease the experience of
            class selection, ambiguous co-requisites for students and most importantly speed up the process of registration.
        </p>
        <p align="left" class="lead" style="margin-top: 10px; color: black;">
            <u>Acceptance Criteria:</u>
            Task 3: The biggest highlight between a typical registration system 1 and S.U.R.S is MinerMe. We already know that
            MinerMe has personal choices such as having the ability to import your own unique degree plan, recommend
            courses but also be able to develop solutions for common questions such as: what if I change majors from
            Nursing to Computer Science how will it impact my career path? A web application that can e-mail you
            notifications to remind you to register for the following semester, attend to orientation etc.
            A system that can track your courses to determine your path to graduation year while minimizing common
            bobo moments.
        </p>
        <p align="left" class="lead" style="margin-top: 10px; color: black;">
            <u>Assumptions:</u>
            Task 4: State any assumptions you may have for this project.
            Assume the user is a part time or full time student.
            We will be using a traditional calendar plan to complete the project under the time frame with 60% accuracy.
            In other words, we will be missing the deadlines about 40% of the time, but that is fine because it is the
            worst case, which is why we are planning ahead of time. For our environment we will be using Inteillij and
            will be using Twitter Bootstrap framework to develop a more artistic interface for the web registration system
            while using MySQL or some form of database to upload and store data...
